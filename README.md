local storage acts like cookies but better. You can store many things including key, oldvaules, newvalues, pages in the form of URL. You can check for local storage within your own web browswer which is pretty cool. Local storage is often times called DOM storage.Its implemented natively within the HTML5. You acces with key/value pairs. You can input Via the console and chang things locally on your web browser with the right commands. Storage is limited to 5 megabytes...so not a ton of storage.
